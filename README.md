## Introduction
This is a terminal based Hangman game. 

The overall goal of this game is for the user to guess letters to complete a secret word. With each incorrect guess another peice of a stick figure man is hung from the gallows. You must complete the word before the figure is completed. 

The game targets primary school children (ages 8-12) who are looking to test their vocabulary and spelling skills. However, older children and adults could also benefit from playing! Â  

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Goals

#### Site Owner Goals
As the Site Owner, I want to create a game that:
  1. captures and holds a users attention.
  2. is educational.

### User Goals
 As a User, I want to:
  1. easily understand the purpose of the game
  2. easily view instructions on how to play the game.
  3. easily and intuitively interact with the game.
  4. be able to see how many guesses I have remaining.
  5. be able to which letters I have correctly guessed. 
  6. be able to easily see the result of the game and be able to play again.


## Design

### Colour
As this is a terminal based game the main colour scheme is white and black. Coloured text is introduced to enhance the user experience and draw attention to warning messages. Red is used for invalid input messages and incorrrect guess messages. Green text is used for correct guesses and to alert the user if they won the game.
